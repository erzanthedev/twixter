# 🐦 Twixter - A Twitter-Inspired Clone

### A Fun, Lightweight Twitter-Like App!

---

## 📌 Overview

**Twixter** is a **Twitter-inspired** app that allows users to **post Twixes (tweets), like Twixes, retwix (retweet), and view replies**. While not an exact replica, it incorporates **similar interactive features** to mimic a **microblogging platform**.

This project was built from scratch as part of **Scrimba’s Frontend Developer Career Course** under the **Solo Project** module. The **main goal** was to **revise and strengthen my JavaScript skills** while implementing real-world UI interactions.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Practice core JavaScript concepts** through hands-on development.
- **Enhance UI/UX skills** by making interactions feel intuitive.
- **Deepen my understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling**.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure for displaying Twixes.
- **CSS** – Styling to resemble a social media feed.
- **JavaScript** – Core functionality for creating, liking, retwixing, and replying.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Post a Twix (Tweet-like post)**  
✅ **Like a Twix ❤️**  
✅ **Retwix (Retweet functionality) 🔁**  
✅ **View and reply to Twixes 💬**  
✅ **Delete Twixes 🗑️**  
✅ **Save Twixes to Local Storage 💾**

## 🔥 Key Concepts Practiced

This project was a great opportunity to test and apply the following **JavaScript concepts**:

✅ **.map()** – To dynamically generate Twixes.  
✅ **.join()** – To format and render Twix elements efficiently.  
✅ **Object destructuring** – To extract relevant data from Twix objects.  
✅ **Arrow functions** – To write concise, modern JavaScript.  
✅ **Ternary conditions** – To handle UI state changes dynamically.  
✅ **Spread operator (`...`)** – To manage Twix data efficiently.  
✅ **Not operator (`!`)** – To toggle states (e.g., liking/unliking).  
✅ **Import/export** – To structure code in a modular way.  
✅ **.contains()** – To check for elements within the DOM.  
✅ **.filter()** – To filter and manipulate Twixes dynamically.
